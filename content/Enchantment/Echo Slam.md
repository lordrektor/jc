### **Description:**

The Echo Slam enchantment creates a shockwave around the user that damages and knocks back nearby enemies. The damage and radius of the shockwave scale with the enchantment's level, offering varying degrees of offensive capability.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Shockwave Damage:**
    
    - Upon activation, Echo Slam generates a shockwave that inflicts damage on nearby enemies. The damage dealt increases with higher enchantment levels.
2. **Constant Knockback Force:**
    
    - The knockback force applied to enemies remains consistent across all levels of the enchantment.
3. **Range Scaling:**
    
    - The radius of the shockwave expands with higher enchantment levels, affecting a wider area around the user upon activation.
4. **Off Hand Only:**
    
    - Echo Slam can only be activated when the enchanted item is in the off hand. It triggers upon right-clicking any item held in the main hand, unleashing the shockwave around the user.
