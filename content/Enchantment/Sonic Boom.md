### **Description:**

The Sonic Boom Enchantment empowers the user to release a powerful sonic blast similar to a warden's roar, capable of piercing through blocks to target concealed enemies or lined-up foes, potentially prompting them to relocate due to the emitted sound cue.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Sonic Blast:**
    
    - Upon activation, the enchanted weapon unleashes a sonic boom that pierces through blocks to target hidden enemies or enemies lined up behind obstacles, utilizing sound as a tactical advantage.
2. **Delayed Activation:**
    
    - The sonic boom activates after a delay of 40 ticks or 2000 milliseconds, ensuring strategic timing for disrupting enemy positions or revealing hidden adversaries.
3. **Main Hand Exclusive:**
    
    - Sonic Boom can only be applied to weapons and activates when held in the main hand, emphasizing tactical positioning and use during combat engagements.
4. **Scalable Damage:**
    
    - The damage inflicted by the sonic boom scales with the enchantment level, increasing its effectiveness against targets within its range.
5. **Scalable Range:**
    
    - The range of the sonic boom, which denotes how far it can penetrate through blocks to affect targets, scales up with higher enchantment levels, expanding its tactical utility.
6. **Shared Cooldown:**
    
    - Cooldown periods for using Sonic Boom are shared among all items enchanted with Sonic Boom per player, promoting coordinated use of this disruptive ability.
