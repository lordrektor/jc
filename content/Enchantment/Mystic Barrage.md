### **Description:**

The Mystic Barrage Enchantment enhances your archery prowess by unleashing a volley of arrows upon hitting a target. After a fixed time of 3 seconds, a barrage of arrows rains down on the struck target within a range of 3x3 blocks.

4. **Damage Compatibility with Power Enchantment:**
