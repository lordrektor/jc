### **Description:**

The Brutal Enchantment enhances your offensive capabilities by increasing the damage dealt based on the target's armor. This enchantment is particularly effective against heavily armored foes, making each strike more devastating as the armor toughness of the target increases.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Armor-Based Damage Boost:**
    
    - The Brutal Enchantment calculates additional damage based on the target's armor. The higher the armor value of the opponent, the more damage this enchantment inflicts, providing a significant advantage in combat against well-armored enemies.
2. **Enchantment Level Scaling:**
    
    - The damage boost provided by the Brutal Enchantment scales with its level. Higher levels result in greater damage increases, amplifying your attacks even further against armored targets.
3. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The enchantment has a fixed cooldown time of 16 seconds, ensuring balanced gameplay and strategic use.
4. **Main Hand Only:**
    
    - The Brutal Enchantment only works when the weapon is equipped in the main hand, focusing the damage boost exclusively from main-hand attacks.
