#### **Description:**
The Immunity Enchantment is a passive protective enchantment exclusive to armor equipment, designed to automatically nullify any negative potion effects applied to the wearer upon activation. This enchantment provides crucial defense against harmful effects, enhancing survivability in challenging encounters.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Potion Immunity:**
	- When the wearer is affected by a negative potion effect, the Immunity Enchantment automatically and instantly removes the effect without requiring any action from the user. This includes effects such as poison, weakness, and other harmful debuffs.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
	- The cooldown for the Immunity Enchantment is shared among all equipped armor pieces with this enchantment. Activation of the immunity effect initiates the cooldown period for all pieces, ensuring balanced usage and strategic management in combat.
3. **Enchantment Level Summation:**
