### **Description:**

The Detonate Enchantment is a special enhancement for bows and crossbows, creating explosive destruction similar to TNT upon arrow impact. The power of the explosion increases with the enchantment's level, providing a significant offensive advantage.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Explosive Impact:**
    
    - When an arrow fired from a bow or crossbow with the Detonate Enchantment hits a target, it produces a TNT-like explosion. The blast radius and damage escalate with higher enchantment levels, making it highly effective against groups of enemies or destructible environments.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown for the Detonate Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use of the explosive effect.
3. **Exclusive Activation:**
    
    - The Detonate Enchantment's explosive effect is exclusively activated when the enchanted bow or crossbow is used in the main hand. This ensures precise control over when the explosive ability is deployed.

### **Usage Instructions:**

- Equip the Detonate Enchantment on your main hand bow or crossbow to unleash explosive power during combat.
- Coordinate attacks to maximize the impact of the explosive effect on groups of enemies or strategic points.
