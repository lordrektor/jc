#### **Key Features:**

1. **Slow Effect on Hit:**
    
    - Upon striking, the Deceleration Enchantment inflicts a slow effect on the target, reducing their movement speed. The duration and strength of this effect escalate with higher enchantment levels, effectively hindering opponents during engagements.
