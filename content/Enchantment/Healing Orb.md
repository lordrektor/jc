#### **Key Features:**

1. **Healing Orb Activation:**
    
    - The Healing Orb enchantment releases a rapid orb that heals a targeted entity when the enchanted weapon is used in the main hand. This effect offers versatile healing options during combat situations. Each activation consumes **100 charge**.
    - Activation of the healing orb effect is exclusive to the main hand, ensuring precise control over when healing is applied.

    - Charge replenishment per kill varies based on the enchantment level, enhancing your ability to sustain healing support over extended engagements.
3. **Fixed Healing Amount:**
    
    - The Healing Orb provides a consistent healing amount of 2 hearts per activation. This reliable healing ensures your allies can endure prolonged battles with sustained health.
4. **Enchantment Level Priority:**
    
    - When using the Healing Orb enchantment on both the off hand and main hand, the enchantment level from the hand with the higher level is prioritized. This ensures that the healing orb's potency and effectiveness are maximized, providing optimal healing support in combat scenarios.
5. **No Cooldown Period:**
    
    - The Healing Orb enchantment operates solely based on its charge level and does not impose a cooldown period. This allows continuous healing support as long as sufficient charge is maintained through combat activities.
