### **Description:**

**Counter Guard** is a specialized enchantment for shields, designed to enhance both defensive and offensive capabilities. This enchantment adds unique effects to your shield blocks, providing strategic advantages in combat. Whether you are actively blocking or caught off-guard, Counter Guard turns your defense into a powerful counterattack.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Active Blocking:** 
	- When you are actively blocking with your shield, Counter Guard functions like a normal shield, blocking all incoming attacks. Additionally, it knockbacks the enemy and grants you a strength potion effect. This activation does trigger 1/3 cooldown duration, allowing frequent use as long as you maintain your block.
2. **Passive Blocking:**
	- When not actively blocking, Counter Guard will block a single attack, knockback the enemy, and inflict a weakness effect on the attacker. This passive activation will trigger a cooldown period, requiring strategic timing.
3. **Off-Hand Exclusive:**
	- This enchantment is designed to work only when the shield is equipped in the off hand, encouraging strategic use of dual-wielding capabilities(with weapon).
4. **Shared Cooldown:**
	- The cooldown period for Counter Guard is shared across all items with the same enchantment. This means triggering the passive blocking effect on one shield will initiate the cooldown period for all shields equipped with Counter Guard, necessitating careful timing in combat.
5. **Potion Effects:**
	- The duration and amplifier of both the strength and weakness potion effects vary depending on the enchantment level, offering greater benefits at higher levels.
6. **Sound Cue:**
	- A successful activation of this passive enchantment will produce an anvil sound effect, providing an audible confirmation of its effectiveness.
7. **Versatile Application:**
	- This enchantment works in both the main hand and off-hand, ensuring versatility in various combat scenarios.

### **Usage Instructions:**

**Combat Strategy:**
- **Active Blocking:** Use your shield to block incoming attacks and gain a temporary strength boost while knocking back your enemies.
- **Passive Blocking:** When caught off-guard, rely on the passive blocking to block a single attack, knock back the attacker, and weaken them. Be mindful of the cooldown period after passive activation.

**Enchantment Level Scaling:** The duration and strength of the potion effects increase with the enchantment level, providing greater advantages at higher levels.
