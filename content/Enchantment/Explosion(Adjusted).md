### **Description:**

The Explosion Enchantment allows the user to release a homing fireball upon usage, which targets and damages enemies. On impact, the fireball chains to nearby enemies, dealing additional damage. The range, damage, and cooldown of the fireball scale with the enchantment level, providing increased effectiveness with higher levels.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Homing Fireball:**
    
    - Upon activation, the enchantment releases a fireball that homes in on the target. The fireball's velocity is fixed, ensuring consistent travel speed.
2. **Main Target Damage:**
    
    - The damage dealt to the main target increases with higher enchantment levels.
3. **Chained Damage:**
    
    - On impact, the fireball's damage chains to nearby enemies. The damage to chained enemies is half of the main target's damage.
4. **Range Scaling:**
    
    - The range within which the fireball targets enemies and the range within which damage chains to nearby enemies both increase with higher enchantment levels.
5. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown period decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use of the enchantment.
6. **Activation and Equipment:**
    
    - The enchantment can be activated by right-clicking while holding an item in the main hand. It can be equipped on both hands, but the higher-level enchantment will take priority. Cooldown is shared across all items with the same enchantment on each player.
