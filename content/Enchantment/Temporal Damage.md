3. **Main Hand Exclusive:**
    
    - Temporal Damage Enchantment can only be applied to weapons held in the main hand, emphasizing its role in direct combat engagements.
4. **Stackable Enchantment:**
    
    - This enchantment stacks with Sharpness, Brutal, and Bane of Defender, allowing for combined effects to maximize damage output.
5. **Cooldown Scaling:**
    
    - The cooldown period for using Temporal Damage Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, optimizing its tactical usage in successive combat scenarios.
6. **Shared Cooldown:**
    
    - Cooldown periods are shared across all items enchanted with Temporal Damage per player, ensuring consistent use in multiplayer settings.
