### **Description:**

The **Arcane Vault** is a powerful enchantment designed to store and manage the experience points (XP) acquired by a player. It comes with a specific capacity denoted by _X_, indicating the maximum amount of experience it can hold.

This enchantment provides a strategic advantage by allowing players to manage their experience points effectively, ensuring that they have access to their hard-earned XP when they need it the most. Whether preparing for a major enchantment or simply safeguarding XP during dangerous expeditions, the **Arcane Vault** offers unparalleled convenience and security.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Experience Storage:**
	- When the enchanted item is held in the player's off-hand, it will automatically store any experience gained. This allows players to safeguard their XP, preventing loss upon death or using it strategically at a later time.
2. **Experience Release:**
    - To retrieve the stored experience, the player simply needs to hold the enchanted item in their main hand and use it. This releases the stored XP back to the player, allowing them to use it for enchanting, repairing, or other purposes.

### **Usage Instructions:**

**Storing Experience:**
    - Equip the enchanted item in your off-hand. As you gain experience through various activities (e.g., defeating mobs, mining, smelting), the XP will be automatically stored within the item until it reaches its capacity.
**Releasing Experience:**
    - When you need to access your stored experience, place the enchanted item in your main hand and use it (typically by right-clicking). The stored XP will then be transferred back to you instantly.

### **Note:**
- Experience points (XP) are stored in the item's meta data using the Persistent Data Container (PDC). Each enchanted item will contain different XP values based on the amount of experience it has stored. This means that the XP stored in one Arcane Vault item is unique to that item and will not transfer to another item.
