### **Description:**

The Lethargy Enchantment applies a slow effect to attackers upon striking the wearer, strategically hindering their movement. The duration and intensity of the slow effect increase with the enchantment's level, offering varying levels of tactical advantage in combat.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Slow Effect on Hit:**
    
    - When attacked, the Lethargy Enchantment inflicts a slow effect on the attacker, reducing their movement speed. The duration and strength of this effect escalate with higher enchantment levels, effectively impeding adversaries during engagements.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown for the Lethargy Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use. This cooldown is shared among all equipped armor pieces enchanted with Lethargy, ensuring coordinated and strategic combat applications.
3. **Enchantment Level Summation:**
    
    - Equipping multiple armor pieces with the Lethargy Enchantment combines their levels, enhancing the slow effect inflicted on attackers. This cumulative enhancement strengthens defensive capabilities against successive strikes.
