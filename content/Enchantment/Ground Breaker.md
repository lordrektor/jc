### **Description:**

The Ground Breaker Enchantment enables a trident to generate a powerful shockwave upon striking the ground, damaging and knocking back nearby players. The shockwave's range scales with the enchantment's level, making it a formidable tool for area control.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Shockwave Activation:**
    
    - When the trident strikes the ground, it creates a shockwave that damages and knocks back nearby players. This effect does not activate upon hitting entities.
2. **Main Hand Exclusive:**
    
    - The Ground Breaker Enchantment is exclusive to tridents and can only be used when the trident is held in the main hand.
3. **Shockwave Range:**
    
    - The range of the shockwave scales with the enchantment level, increasing its effective area of impact.
4. **Damage Based on Trident:**
    
    - The damage dealt by the shockwave is based on the actual damage of the trident itself.
5. **Fixed Knockback Power:**
    
    - The knockback power of the shockwave remains consistent across all levels of the enchantment.
6. **Shared Cooldown:**
    
    - The cooldown for the Ground Breaker Enchantment is shared across all items with the same enchantment on each player, ensuring balanced usage.
