#### **Description:**

The Decay Enchantment applies a wither effect to the target upon striking, strategically inflicting damage over time. The duration and intensity of the wither effect increase with the enchantment's level, providing varying degrees of tactical advantage in combat.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Wither Effect on Hit:**
    
    - When attacking, the Decay Enchantment inflicts a wither effect on the target, causing continuous damage. The duration and strength of this effect escalate with higher enchantment levels, effectively weakening opponents during engagements.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown duration for the Decay Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use. This cooldown is shared between both the main hand and off hand equipped with Decay, ensuring coordinated and strategic combat applications.
3. **Enchantment Level Priority:**
    
    - When using the Decay Enchantment on both hands, the higher enchantment level is prioritized, determining the strength and duration of the wither effect. This ensures that the most potent enchantment is always in effect.
