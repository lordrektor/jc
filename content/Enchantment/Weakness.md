#### **Description:**

The **Weakness Enchantment** applies a Weakness effect to attackers upon striking the wearer, strategically reducing their melee attack damage. The duration and intensity of the Weakness effect increase with the enchantment's level, providing varying levels of tactical advantage in combat.

##### **Key Features:**

1. **Weakness Effect on Hit:**
    
    - When attacked, the Weakness Enchantment inflicts a Weakness effect on the attacker, diminishing their melee damage output. The duration and strength of this effect escalate with higher enchantment levels, effectively impairing adversaries during engagements.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown for the Weakness Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use. This cooldown is shared among all equipped armor pieces enchanted with Weakness, ensuring coordinated and strategic combat applications.
3. **Enchantment Level Summation:**
    
    - Equipping multiple armor pieces with the Weakness Enchantment combines their levels, enhancing the Weakness effect inflicted on attackers. This cumulative enhancement strengthens defensive capabilities against successive strikes.

#### **Usage Instructions:**

- Activate the Weakness Enchantment to exploit its strategic advantage by weakening attackers during combat engagements.
- Coordinate defenses to maximize the impact of the Weakness effect, considering the shared cooldown among all equipped armor pieces with this enchantment.
