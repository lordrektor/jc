#### **Description:**

The **Disintegration Enchantment** inflicts a wither effect on attackers when they strike the wearer, imparting a potent offensive deterrent. The duration and strength of the wither effect increase with the enchantment's level, providing escalating levels of protection against assailants.

##### **Key Features:**

1. **Wither Effect on Hit:**
    - Upon being struck, the Disintegration Enchantment applies a wither effect to the attacker. The duration and intensity of the wither effect amplify with higher enchantment levels, effectively weakening adversaries during combat.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    - The cooldown duration for the Disintegration Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, enabling more frequent application. This cooldown is shared among all equipped armor pieces enchanted with Disintegration, ensuring balanced use in extended engagements.
3. **Enchantment Level Summation:**
    - Equipping multiple armor pieces with the Disintegration Enchantment aggregates their levels, intensifying the wither effect inflicted on attackers. This cumulative enhancement enhances defensive capabilities against successive strikes.
