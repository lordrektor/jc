#### **Description:**

The Debility Enchantment applies a weakness effect to the target upon striking, strategically reducing their attack damage. The duration and intensity of the weakness effect increase with the enchantment's level, providing varying degrees of tactical advantage in combat.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Weakness Effect on Hit:**
    
    - When attacking, the Debility Enchantment inflicts a weakness effect on the target, diminishing their melee damage output. The duration and strength of this effect escalate with higher enchantment levels, effectively impairing opponents during engagements.
2. **Cooldown Management:**
    
    - The cooldown duration for the Debility Enchantment decreases with higher enchantment levels, allowing for more frequent use. This cooldown is shared between both the main hand and off hand equipped with Debility, ensuring coordinated and strategic combat applications.
3. **Enchantment Level Priority:**
    
    - When using the Debility Enchantment on both hands, the higher enchantment level is prioritized, determining the strength and duration of the weakness effect. This ensures that the most potent enchantment is always in effect.
