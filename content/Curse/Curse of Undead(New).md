The **Curse of Undead** enchantment curses the wearer, increasing the damage received when struck by a weapon enchanted with Smite. The amount of increased damage scales based on both the level of the Smite and Curse of Undead enchantments, making it particularly disadvantageous against enemies wielding weapons enchanted with Smite.
