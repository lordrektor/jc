#### **Start Quest**
**Has requirement:** None

**Player**: "Hello, Sir Galen. Do you need any help?"
**Sir Galen**: "Ah, a brave adventurer! Just the person I need. Dark times have befallen our village. Bandits have stolen the Sword of Valor, a relic of great power and significance."
**Player**: "The Sword of Valor? It sounds important. Where can I find it?"
**Sir Galen**: "Indeed, it is. Without it, we cannot defend ourselves against the growing threats. The bandits were last seen heading towards the Shadowy Forest. It's a dangerous place, but I believe in your strength and courage."
**Player**: "I'll find the Sword of Valor and bring it back."
**Sir Galen**: "Thank you, brave one. Be cautious; the forest is teeming with perilous creatures and treacherous paths. Return to me once you have the sword, and you shall be richly rewarded."
**Player**: "I won't let you down, Sir Galen."
