_Player approaches Liora Windrider, who looks concerned and busy with her herbs._

**Liora Windrider**: Oh, hello there! I'm in quite a bind and could use some help.

**Player**: What's wrong, Liora?

**Liora Windrider**: I'm running low on a rare potion that my sister, Elara, usually prepares. It's vital for treating some of the villagers who are ill. Could you please go to Elara and ask her to make more of it?

**Player**: Of course. What’s the potion called?

**Liora Windrider**: It’s called the Elixir of Restoration. Elara will know exactly what you mean. Thank you so much for doing this. You’ll find her near the old oak tree in the forest.

**Player**: I’ll speak with her right away.

**Liora Windrider**: Thank you. Please hurry. The villagers are depending on us.
