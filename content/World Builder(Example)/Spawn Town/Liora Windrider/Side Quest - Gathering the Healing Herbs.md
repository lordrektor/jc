**Initial Quest Dialogue**

_Player approaches Liora Windrider, who is organizing various plants and herbs in a small basket._

**Liora Windrider**: Oh, hello again! Just the person I was hoping to see. I could use some assistance with an urgent matter.

**Player**: What do you need, Liora?

**Liora Windrider**: I’m running low on a few specific herbs that are crucial for preparing healing potions. There's been an increase in injuries lately, and I need to restock as soon as possible. Unfortunately, these herbs only grow in certain parts of the forest, and I can't leave my current work.

**Player**: What kind of herbs are you looking for?

**Liora Windrider**: I need three types of herbs: Moonleaf, Sunblossom, and Nightshade. They are essential for making potions that heal wounds, cure poison, and restore stamina. Moonleaf can be found near the forest springs, Sunblossom grows in sunny clearings, and Nightshade tends to be in the darker, shadier parts of the forest.

**Player**: I can gather those for you. Anything else I should know?

**Liora Windrider**: Just be careful, especially with Nightshade. It can be a bit tricky to handle. Thank you so much for your help. I'll be here, preparing the other ingredients while you gather the herbs.

**Player**: I’ll be back soon with the herbs.

**Liora Windrider**: Thank you, and please be careful. The forest can be unpredictable.
