**Player**: Hello, Elara. Your sister, Liora, sent me. She needs more of the Elixir of Restoration for the villagers.
**Elara Windrider**: Ah, yes, the Elixir of Restoration. I can certainly make more, but I’m currently out of a few key ingredients. I could use your help to gather them.
**Player**: What do you need?
**Elara Windrider**: I need three things: 1) Moonflower petals, 2) Essence of Nightshade, and 3) Pure spring water. Additionally, I’ll need my alchemy tools which are back at my campsite. Can you gather these for me?
**Player**: Of course. Where can I find these items?
**Elara Windrider**: The Moonflower petals can be found near the forest edge at dusk. The Essence of Nightshade is a bit trickier—it grows in the darker, shadier parts of the forest. And the pure spring water can be collected from the sacred spring to the north. My alchemy tools are at my campsite, just west of here.
**Player**: I’ll gather everything you need.
**Elara Windrider**: Thank you. I’ll start preparing the other ingredients while you gather those. Be careful, especially with the Nightshade.


#### **Done Quest**
**Has requirement:** 
- Moonflower Petals x5
- Essence of Nightshade x3
- Pure spring water x1
- Alchemy Flask x1


**Player**: I’ve gathered everything you asked for, Elara.
**Elara Windrider**: Wonderful! Let’s see... Moonflower petals, Essence of Nightshade, pure spring water, and my alchemy tools. This is perfect. Give me a moment to prepare the elixir.

_Elara works with the ingredients and her tools, creating the Elixir of Restoration._

**Elara Windrider**: Here you go. This should be more than enough for the villagers. Please take this back to Liora and let her know that everything should be fine now.
**Player**: Thank you, Elara. I’ll take it to her right away.
**Elara Windrider**: Safe travels, and thank you for your help.
